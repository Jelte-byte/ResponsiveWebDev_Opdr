        <div class="wikitext">
            D6 (sometimes written as D-6, Russian: Д-6), also referred to as Metro 2, is a desolate top secret government/military facility, featured towards the later part of Metro 2033, and is prominently featured in Metro: Last Light. A focal point of the game's plot, it's in this sealed facility that Artyom must aid his companions in finding and arming the missile launching facilities outside Moscow, necessary to strike at the Dark Ones.
            <br><br>
            A location very similar to D6 is mentioned in Metro 2035, but the name itself is never used and the place is only referred to as a "bunker". It's an important strategic point that saw a massive attack from the Red Line happen, just like the Battle for D6, sometime between the events of the book and Metro 2034.

            Located deep underground near the Barrikadnaya and Mayakovskaya Stations and west of Reich, D6 is a massive bunker-like facility whose access routes are well-hidden in the Metro, and existence is regarded as something of a legend among the underground dwellers. Information found at the Lenin Library allow Artyom, Miller, and a group of Rangers, each with their own specialty, to reach one of such entrances, located near Kievskaya Station. It could be presumed that said accesses are roughly similar to each other, consisting of massive airlocks concealing rooms used for storing machinery and spare equipment, gradually leading further underground, to what appears to be the remains of an old mine shaft. 
            <br><br>
            Even deeper are the only known ways into the facility itself, automated monorails which lead directly to D6 via tunnels separated from the metro. Said network is known as Metro-2, and unlike the main Metro is built on a monorail system instead of the standard two rail design. The Metro-2 network, being built deeper underground, is far more intact and traversable. It is unknown how far in each direction the network stretches, but there are at least six distinct lines and it's possible to directly reach Telesentr (the Ostankino TV tower) and the Botanical Gardens in the more northern part of the city from D6, which is located in the western portion somewhere under the Green Line. It is known that of all the Metro-2 lines (which are designated C1-C6), Line C5 heads eastwards, Line C3 heads north/northeast, and C4 heads southwards towards Kievskaya. It's likely the Metro-2 trains connect to the major government installations: FSB headquarters, Vnukovo Airport, the Kremlin, and other important surface facilities.

            D6 itself is an enormous installation centered around a very large central shaft comprised of two main sectors and one smaller sector, each with four sub-sections: A1-A4, B1-B4, and D2. The perimeter of the shaft houses the Metro-2 automated monorails and the control station that directs electricity through the facility and controls the air re-circulation system. To descend into the facility proper, two rail carts can be utilized, spiraling downwards to the four main floors of the shaft:                 <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sector A is likely the Command and Control level, with a Command Center located in Subsector A1 and a larger one in A4. What A2 and A3 house is not revealed. It's in A1 where Artyom, Vladimir, Ulman, and Miller head to activate the missiles to strike at the Dark Ones. Both command facilities are fairly identical with rows of computer banks with telephones, connected to systems that allow for command and control of outside military forces or facilities. Lighted maps of Moscow display the status of launching facilities and can be remotely accessed from this location. In Metro: Last Light, the Command Center in A4 is the main one, and is where Artyom receives his mission to kill the remaining Dark One in the Botanical Gardens. Direct elevator access for two of the Metro-2 monorails is available from this location, via elevators C3 and C4.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Sector B contains domiciles, storage, and laboratories, where presumably the base's staff would reside and conduct other research. It's here that Artyom and the Rangers take up residence, in Subsector B2. The area is well equipped, with a kitchen, lounge areas, gymnasium, firing range, and ample quarters. What B1 and B3 house is not revealed but it's likely to be additional access, storage, and laboratories. Sector B4, as revealed in Metro: Last Light, is the place in which the Dark Ones hibernate while their brethren were wiped out on the surface.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Sector D, the deepest part of the facility, lies beneath the main shaft and can be accessed by an elevator marked D2. This is where the nuclear reactor and main generators lie, along with the control facilities necessary to maintain them. Elevator access directly to the monorail level is available from the reactor in case of elevator failure.
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            On every level of the facility are electric trams used for transport of personnel and materials, though most are inoperable after 20 years due to power failure. Massive sealed doors on all the floors of D6 apparently lead to unknown parts of the facility, including huge storage rooms filled with military hardware - tanks and other armored vehicles, missile launchers, including what appear to be RT-2UTTKh "Topol-M'" Mobile Intercontinental Ballistic Missile units, huge stashes of ammunition and weapons, and so on. If the weapons stored in D6 are not enough, the facility has remote control of many other missile launchers outside the D6, including the BM-30 Smerch mobile rocket launcher, although most facilities are destroyed before the Rangers' arrival, with only one unit in the outskirts of Southeastern Moscow being active.
