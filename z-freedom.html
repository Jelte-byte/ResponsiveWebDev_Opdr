            Freedom is a clan of stalkers who fight for free access to the Zone, and their views are somewhat anarchistic, believing nobody can own the Zone and seeing it both as a scientific marvel and as a free life inside the Zone's borders. Because of their ideals they constantly find themselves in conflict with the Military and their long time nemesis, Duty. They view Duty as no more than a clan of jarheads who see nothing, hear nothing, and only know how to pull a trigger, as instead of finding a way to co-exist with the Zone, they attempt to destroy it, whereby the Zone retaliates with mutant attacks, anomalies, radiation hazards and blowouts. Similar in size and manpower to Duty, they have the offensive strength but medium and at times low resources to wage a faction war against Duty.
            <br><br>
            In contrast to the regimented, highly disciplined atmosphere of Duty, the members of Freedom have a much more relaxed, informal attitude. They appear to have a more casual command structure, often referring to each other as "bro", with a number of members shown making regular recreational use of alcohol and marijuana. This further reflects their status as a clan of like-minded free spirits, unlike the ex-military soldiers of Duty. Regardless, Freedom members are able to function very effectively as an organized fighting force when necessary.

            Freedom was founded by a group of free stalkers, including Chekhov, Lingov, Lukash, and Loki, aiming to research the Zone and make its fruit, artifacts and anomalies (in the words of Chekhov a ready-made outdoor lab), available to the general public. The core principle, liberty for all its members, has led its opponents to view it as a volatile mix of anarchists and rogues.
            <br><br>
            By 2011, Freedom occupied and secured the Dark Valley, reinforcing the unfinished research facility as their base of operations. In September, all Freedom units not deployed elsewhere were recalled to the valley in response to a series of mysterious attacks that claimed many Freedom fighter lives. As discovered by Scar, these attacks were the work of a group of mercenaries hired by an unknown employer, who used their mole, Commandant Lingov, to plan raids on Freedom positions. With Scar's help, the mercenaries were driven from the valley and entrances to the underground tunnel network collapsed.
            <br><br>
            Elsewhere, in the Army Warehouses, a separate detachment under the command of Kostyan has set up operations near the western passage to Red Forest. Their plan was simple: eliminate the weak military presence in the warehouses and claim them for the faction. The soldiers were stranded in the base following the second emission, unable to call for reinforcements or extraction. Eventually, with Scar's help, the stalkers succeeded and the warehouses became Freedom's second base, temporarily granting them the status of the most powerful faction in the Zone.
            <br><br>
            This did not last. Freedom had spread its forces too thin in the course of its conquest and the war with Duty. Bandits led by Borov exploited their weakness and pushed them out of Dark Valley, claiming it for themselves. In response, Freedom moved its headquarters to the Army Warehouses and recalled their forces from all territories south of the Bar. Chekhov apparently either resigned or died during this period, with Lukash becoming the next leader of the faction.
            <br><br>
            Under his leadership, Freedom ceased to actively fight Duty. While relations were still hostile between the two groups, both Lukash and General Voronin were reluctant to continue the war, as it would weaken both factions for no real benefit. Another factor was that Freedom took it upon themselves to maintain the Barrier and defend it from mutants and Monolith fanatics attempting to breach it.
            <br><br>
            When Strelok shut down the Brain Scorcher, Freedom instantly sent a large, elite detachment of troops to scout and secure Pripyat. As Duty did the same, the two forces clashed in Red Forest, neither willing to step back. This resulted in the first major engagement between the factions since the war in 2011. The two factions would continue to fight against each other and Monolith fanatics in the ruins of Pripyat, for the control of the city.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, new territories became accessible in the north. Loki, a young yet brilliant leader, was sent together with a large detachment of troops to secure Yanov for the faction. They clashed with Duty forces under Lt. Col. Shulga's command, but had the upper hand as they held the station. In the middle of the fighting, a Duty member known as Zulu felt a blowout was coming. Reluctant to leave their sworn enemies to die in one of the most horrid ways possible, they let them inside the station and hunkered down together. Confused as to what to do in this situation, leaders of both detachments agreed to a ceasefire; while fighting outside the station was fair game, both agreed to treat Yanov as neutral ground and share its facilities.
